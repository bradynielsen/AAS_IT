Degree and Course Information for Spokane Falls Community College Applied Associate of Science Information Technology Degree Plan Fall 2021 Implementation 
Last revision date 1-19-2021
This project is a degree review and renovation of the Applied Associate of Science Information Technology Degree at Spokane Falls Community College.  Below is a check list of milestones and a description of the degree change concerns.  The final portion of this document is a brief description of the contents of this project.  All of this is uploaded on MS Word documents as they are the official forms for the change request process.  Supporting documents were created before I decided to use Github.
 
Current Status of AAS Information Technology degree plan - under development
Successfully Completed - Advisory Board Review
Pending - SFCC Administrative Review (Dean, CGRC preview)
Successfully Completed - Advisory Board Vote
Pending - CGRC Submission
Pending - CGRC Vote

Concerns - Changes proposed could be perceived as 'significant' requiring State Board Approval, this would introduce a potential delay.  The format has changed, but the content is less than 20% (13.333%) so we should be ok.  It is a lot to describe to someone, but not substantially changed.

Documents in the Classes Folder-

Course information sheet and course learning outcomes for all courses that will be edited or created. Each course has its own folder.  CS223, IS101, IS102, IS103, IS106, IS125, IS132, IS165, IS166, IS210, IS215, IS222, IS228, IS234, IS244, IS245, IS260, IS262, IS288.  The course information sheet includes Catalog Description and prerequisites amongst other things less important.  The course learning outcomes are what we are supposed to teach and assess.  They are hopefully all formatted similarly and consistent.  I adjusted almost every course on that list for the prerequisites, catalog description and learning outcomes.  I will review one more time after I send the documents to my dean and the CGRC preview committee.  1-19-2021
